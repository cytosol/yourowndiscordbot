# yourowndiscordbot
A commented tutorial on making a discord bot with Python.
You'll learn how to make your bot talk, and listen to commands using discord.py!
## How to Use
**You'll need asyncio, discord.py, and aiohttp**
First, download the repository or use the command to clone the git.
Next, open the script and follow the tutorial to make your own bot.
**Note: you should use the discord.py docs to help you.**
After, acquire your bot token by creating a bot account for your bot. Then, put it where 'token' is and run your bot using 'python3.5 mainscript.py' and it should work.
